# Comparison of the exponential distribution and the Central Limit Theorem

**Purpose:** The objective of the simulation exercise is to explore the exponential distribution and its relationship with the Central Limit Theorem.

**Introduction:** The Exponential distribution is: ... 
The Central Theorem is:

By doing this simulation I expect that:

**Part 1A - Simulation -graph:** In the first part of the project, a simulation of 1000 exponential distributions with a n=40 and a rate parameter of 0.2 will be performed.

**part 1B - Theoretical vs Simulation; Comparison of the Means**The CLT states that the distribution of averages of iid variables becomes that of a standard

**part 1C - Variance** According with the Central Limit Theorem, the distribution of the sample variance of a random sample from a population is centered at the population variance. This means that on average, the sample variances will be equal to the population variance. The sample variance is a measure of the spread of data within a sample, and it is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each data point and the sample mean. 
When multiple random samples are taken, the sample variances will vary around 
the population variance. However, the distribution of these sample variances is
centered at the population variance, indicating that the average sample variance
will be equal to the population variance.

**Part 1D - Distributions**

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
